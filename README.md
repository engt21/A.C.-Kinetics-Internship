# A.C.-Kinetics-Internship

Authors: Timothy Eng, Isabelle Chong, Michelle Morgenthal, Kyle Unger
Created: May 2017
Completed: June 2017
Programs/languages used: Arduino (C), Mathematica (Wolfram language)

Description: A sorting device that was independently designed, constructed, and coded in a team with 3 others that combined Arduino and Mathematica. We implemented Mathematicaâ€™s built in machine learning/image recognition/neural net and Arduino to control servos via serial input to sort objects like screws, wire connectors, and Legos. Every stage of the project was designed by us, and we had to mostly buy our own supplies and create the setup ourselves. The project was completed over the course of 6 weeks. 

I wrote the C code to drive servo attached to bin via serial input and also wrote Mathematica code that integrated the neural net and the servo systems.
